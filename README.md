# SentenceSynthesis

Generates sentences based off two data sets, as csv files, using bigram and trigram models. Any files would work in theory, but the ones used were wine reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) and Democratic debate transcripts from the 2020 primary elections (https://www.kaggle.com/brandenciranni/democratic-debate-transcripts-2020). Files were not included due to GitHub's file size maximum
